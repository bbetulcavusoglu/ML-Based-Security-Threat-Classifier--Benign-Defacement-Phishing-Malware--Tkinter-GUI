# ML Based Security Threat Classifier; Benign, Defacement, Phishing and Malware - Tkinter-GUI
Training data from a data set consisting of benign, defacement, phishing and malware classes with Machine learning algorithms. and I made a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application with the model I trained with the Python Tkinter library.

📍 I couldn't add it to the repo because the model I trained was large in size. You can check out how I trained the model and the Kaggle link below to download and use the model on your own computer.

After running the Kagge notebook, all you have to do is: Download the model, put it in the same directory with the file with main.py extension and run it 🚀
